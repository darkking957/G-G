**Task**: Combine two reasoning paths to create a more powerful composite path.

**Question**: {question}
**Path 1**: {thought1_str}
**Path 2**: {thought2_str}

**Aggregation Strategies**:

1. **Sequential Connection**: If Path 1's endpoint can be Path 2's starting point
   - Result: Path1 → Path2
   - Use when: Paths form a natural sequence

2. **Parallel Combination**: If paths answer different aspects of the question
   - Result: [Path1, Path2] (both needed)
   - Use when: Question has multiple parts

3. **Union/Merge**: If paths overlap or complement each other
   - Result: Combined unique relations
   - Use when: Paths share common elements

4. **Refinement**: If one path generalizes/specializes the other
   - Result: The more specific path
   - Use when: One path subsumes the other

5. **Bridge Construction**: If paths can be connected via intermediate relations
   - Result: Path1 → [bridge] → Path2
   - Use when: Paths are related but not directly connectable

**Analysis Required**:
1. Identify how the paths relate to each other
2. Determine which strategy best serves the question
3. Construct the aggregated path
4. Explain why this aggregation improves the answer

**Output** (JSON only):
{
    "aggregated_path": ["relation1", "relation2", "relation3"],
    "aggregation_type": "sequential",
    "explanation": "Path 1 finds the company, Path 2 finds its CEO, creating a complete answer",
    "confidence": 0.9
