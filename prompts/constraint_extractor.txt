# prompts/constraint_extractor.txt
Analyze the question: "{question}". 
Extract key semantic constraints that the answer must satisfy.

Constraints to consider:
- **entity_type**: What type of entity should the answer be? (e.g., Person, Location, Organization, Date, Number)
- **temporal_relation**: Any time-related constraints? (e.g., before/after a date, during a period)
- **spatial_relation**: Any location-related constraints? (e.g., in a country, near a place)
- **quantity**: Any numerical constraints? (e.g., more than, exactly, at least)
- **attribute**: Specific attributes the answer must have (e.g., gender, nationality, status)
- **relation_type**: What relationship should the answer have with entities in the question?

Output ONLY valid JSON. Example:
{{"entity_type":"Person","temporal_relation":"after 2000","attribute":{{"role":"director"}}}}

If no specific constraint is found, return: {{}}
